//MARK: Bubble Sort algorithm

/*
 So it is a not so effecient algorithm where it goes twice in the
 same array, verifying if the actual value is greater than the next value
 until it reaches the last value minus 1 minus the position in the index, so it
 will be - 1 than - 2 than - 3.
 It has O(nÂ²) time complexity and O(1) for space complexity.
